## AurSunao

### Team OneMoreHack
 In times you feel all alone, now you too have someone to say "Aur Sunao!"

### Idea

Amidst the pandemic where life, career and everything in between are at crossroads, we have always wanted somebody, to whom we can pour our hearts out to. In the fast pacing world, when everyone are selfish and running for success, we wish somebody could hear our unheard voices. If only we could pour out hearts out, could we fight the demons in our minds and grow better with great mental health and happiness. So, we bring with us, that "somebody", a daily diary buddy which can listen to you, convert your words into text logs and save them. Talking alone can help us, but to up our game, we also have an intelligent emotion detector, which can tell your emotions from your voice, colour your logs according to your emotions and also, suggest you things to do according to your emotions!
